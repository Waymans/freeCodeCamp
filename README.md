The dates are not exact. The date on each cert is from the date when you claim it, 
not when you finish all of the projects for that particular cert. Sometimes I did not
claim it right then when I finished all of the projects. Anyhow, thats besides the point.
I learned a lot with this curriculum and still have much more to experience and learn!
Thankful for FCC in doing what they do.
